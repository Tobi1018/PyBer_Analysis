# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
  Our analysis aims is to create a summary Data frame that will display ride-sharing information by city type (rural, urban, suburban). Using the data we found, we will create a multiple line graph showing weekly fares for each type of city.  Using the pandas groupby() function with the count() and sum () to get the total number of drivers, rides, and fares by city type. Using this information we were able to calculate our average fare per rider based on the functions we assigned. Our next step would be to format the completed data into new Data frame columns.
