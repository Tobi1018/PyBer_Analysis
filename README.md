# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
  Our analysis aims is to create a summary Data frame that will display ride-sharing information by city type (rural, urban, suburban). Using the data we found, we will create a multiple line graph showing weekly fares for each type of city.  Using the pandas groupby() function with the count() and sum () to get the total number of drivers, rides, and fares by city type. Using this information we were able to calculate our average fare per rider based on the functions we assigned. Our next step would be to format the completed data into new Data frame columns.

## Results:

Rural cities appear to be more expensive than urban ones in terms of fares per ride. The average ride fare in rural cities is about $34.62, while the average in urban cities is $24.53. Whereas the suburban city's average fare per ride was around $30.97. Rural cities typically charge an average fare of $55.49 per driver, whereas urban cities charge an average fare of $16.57 per driver. Typically, suburban cities charge about $39.50 for each ride per driver.

As shown in the below multiple-line chart "Total Fare by City Type," it provides trends for total fares in rural, suburban, and urban cities from January through April 2019. In the urban, the average fare in urban areas ranged from $1,650 to $2,400 from January through April. As seen on the Suburban line chart, each total fare (in dollars) ranges between $600 and $1450. The rural cities' total fares range from $300 from the beginning and increase to $500 in the month of April.

## Summary:
In conclusion, rural areas tend to have higher average fares than all other city types because there are fewer drivers in the rural areas, no one wants to drive here, and the travel time and distance are longer, which results in a higher average fare.
